# Background
For many industries, the impact of COVID has largely changed their operating models and the needs of their target consumers. As a student living in Allegheny County, Pittsburgh during the pandemic, my demand for food delivery has changed most obviously and my friends also responded to the same needs. The objective of this project is to introduce food delivery service to audience, why people choose it and help audience to choose the most suitable app or website. I also plan to analysis the COVID impact on people’s need for food delivery, which works as an evidence to emphasis the popularity and advantage of this service during this special period.

# Data
Currently I plan to use the public data from ‘Google Trends’ to measure the interest in each food delivery company within PA, which helps to measure their popularity. However, I’m still working on whether I can narrow this group of data down to Allegheny County.

Also, I found an excel dataset from ‘Google’s Community Mobility Reports’ and filtered the data of Allegheny County (375 rows). I will concentrate on ‘retail_and_recreation_percent_change_from_baseline’ and ‘grocery_and_pharmacy_percent_change_from_baseline’ to measure the impact of COVID to people’s mobility to restaurants, shopping centers and so on.
