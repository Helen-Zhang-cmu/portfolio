Based on the data from OECD, I created the line chart for each country which help to display how goverment debt (counted as % of GDP) changed over time. The specific number of 2019 are highlighted with a dot to emphasize the latest data. Some countries have missing value for some years, so their trend line turn to be shorter than those have record for all years. The data source are displayed in the footer.
