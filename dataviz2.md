Based on the data from OECD, I created the line chart for each country which help to display how goverment debt (counted as % of GDP) changed over time. The specific number of 2019 are highlighted with a dot to emphasize the latest data. Some countries have missing value for some years, so their trend line turn to be shorter than those have record for all years. The data source are displayed in the footer.

This grid of bar chart helps us to better understand the difference between target countries' government debt (measured in percentage of each country's GDP) within each year from 1995-2019. I choose this graph because in the grid line chart we made previously is mainly concentrate on each country's changing trend. I changed the number of graph displayed in each row for this graph, because if there are too many single graphs in one row, audience can hardly read x-axis if all countries' name are required to be showed. 
Also, I reordered the countries according to their value for each year, so the audience can better figure out the rank position for the country they want to check. The color choice here is dark blue, which can make eyes comfortable and clear enough to display the information. If we want to particularly emphasis the value for one country, we can change the color of its bar into red.
