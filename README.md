# About me
Hi! I'm Helen Zhang, a girl like cats, dogs and dinosaurs!
I'm a second year MSPPM student and maybe I will become a consultant after graduating from Heinz.
I have interest and passion on data visualization because I wish to get the ability of better convey my insights through a impressive way. This is an important ability for consultant.

# What I hope to learn
I want to learn about the different types of visualization graphs and how can we better meet them with the data we have. Also, I'm willing to know which website or app we can use to generate graphs in an easy way, which can help me get my work done efficiently in the future.
