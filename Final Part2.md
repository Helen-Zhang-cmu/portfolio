# Food Delivery Service
For many industries, the impact of COVID has largely changed their operating models and the needs of their target consumers. As a student living in Allegheny County, Pittsburgh during the pandemic, my demand for food delivery has changed most obviously and my friends also responded to the same needs. The objective of this project is to introduce food delivery service to audience, why people choose it and help audience to choose the most suitable app or website.

# Revisions I plan to do for next week
1. Add a graph of people's changing demand for food delivery services. I found the dataset from Google mobility report, but i still need to decide the scope of data. Whether it's more helpful to concentrate on Allegeny county or PA or the whole US? I plan to create this graph as a line chart, which can display the trend of demand changing.
2. Enrich the platforms comparision section. I will pick at least five measurable aspect to rate the platform and finalized the current radar chart. Also, to better explain the aspects such as membership benefits, I will add these columns into the comparision table and highlight all numbers. 
3. Create all graphs using flourish and generate the final report using canva.
