# Food Delivery Service
For many industries, the impact of COVID has largely changed their operating models and the needs of their target consumers. As a student living in Allegheny County, Pittsburgh during the pandemic, my demand for food delivery has changed most obviously and my friends also responded to the same needs. The objective of this project is to introduce food delivery service to audience, why people choose it and help audience to choose the most suitable app or website. I also plan to analysis the COVID impact on people’s need for food delivery, which works as an evidence to emphasis the popularity and advantage of this service during this special period.
